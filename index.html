            A README file is a text file that contains information for all other
            files within a directory. The README file serves as a type of manual
            and a way for visitors to learn the What, Why and How of the
            project.
          </p>
          <p>Many times this is the first file a user will view.</p>
          <p>
            The file name is usually written in uppercase letters, for example:
          </p>
          <code>README.TXT, READ.ME, README.md</code>

            Think of your README as a kind of home-base for your directory. This
            is the place for you to include detailed documentation that will
            allow your project to be easily navigated. Why? The easier your
            project is to navigate the more engagement you will receive.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>The README file will allow visitors to:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Engage with your project.</li>
            <li>Navigate your code easily.</li>
            <li>Find answer to common questions.</li>
            <li>Determine what the project is about.</li>
            <li>Learn how the project is used.</li>
            <li>Discover how your project was made.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is encouraged that ever project include a detailed README file.
            Make a routine of creating a README file with every project you
            create.

            Every README file should include important documentation. This can
            include anything the creator chooses but the most important items
            are a Title, Description and How To.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><b>The following are recommended:</b></p>

            Typically a README is created in text file format with markdown.
            This will allow creativity in a clean minimalist format.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you can freehand the creation of your README there are
            applications out there to help maximize your time and organization.
          </p>
          <p><i>For example: https://www.mkdocs.org/ is a great site.</i></p>

            >Your README can be simple and minimalistic! Just make sure to
            include the important details.
